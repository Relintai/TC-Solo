# TC-Solo

I made a bunch of items for TrinityCore (WoW 3.3.5a) to make instances soloable for the lolz (and to learn some game design).
I also messed with making vendors because why not.

I think I made everything except the stuff in the allclass folder.

It was made to work with a TrinityCore compiled around Dec 2, 2014.
